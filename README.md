I worked at Mathnasium and got promoted to be moderator support for large, online classrooms. Created app for my employer, Mathnasium, to allow parents easy access to statistics and notes on children behavior. Includes admin privileges and other mechanisms for workers within Mathnasium to edit data on students for display to parents. Utilized Google Sheets API and Fetch API with JavaScript to read and edit Google Sheets. Displayed editable user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with log-in functionality.
